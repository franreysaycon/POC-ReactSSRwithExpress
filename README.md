# Franrey's Portofolio Using React and Styled Components

## Introduction

I've always wanted to create my own Portfolio and I took the challenge of not using any website builders out there.
I'm an advocate of open source technologies so I will be using only this.
The code will be public for now but if there's a need to make it private in the future I would create a starter boilerplate for the project.
So that anyone can do what I did.

Hopefully this could bubble up into a great site. I'm planning to use AWS for my server needs.

## Prerequisites

1. Node v8
2. React v16
3. Yarn v1.13

## How To Run

1. yarn install - this should install everything you need. I have to clean the dependecines from my tinkering.
2. yarn start

## Linting

I basically used Sublime Editor for my automatic linting needs.
Install ESLint-Formatter. More details can be found here: https://github.com/TheSavior/ESLint-Formatter

## TODO

1. Create Main Portfolio Introduction Page
2. Create About Me Page
3. Create Projects Page

## Architecturial Specifics
1. Incorporate React-Router in SSR for the application.
2. Create Helmet Definitions
3. Clean up server code.
4. Fix Hydrate issue on compile.

## Optional
1. Make auto-browser refresh work. (can't seem to make it hapen with my current setup.)
